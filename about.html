                        The Astrodon Quartet brings together four exceptional musicians dedicated to the art of the string quartet. Unified by
                        their devotion to their craft and their commitment to community service, they strive to bring the highest quality of
                        musical performance and education to communities of every socioeconomic status.

                        Named for the first dinosaur discovered in their home state of Maryland, the group shares a love for the city of
                        Baltimore almost as deep as their love for the string quartet repertoire. Individually, Astrodon’s musicians represent
                        three states and two countries; but Baltimore is the city which has nurtured their growth as a unit. Its spirit of
                        cooperation, determination, and creativity has inspired them in every moment of their journey, from the local
                        organizations they visit to the students they teach to the three community gardens in their neighborhood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        In performance, the group has been described as “captivating,” “moving,” and “unbelievably beautiful.” Their emotional
                        depth, spontaneity, and gift for audience engagement has created meaningful experiences for audiences of many walks of
                        life across Baltimore and Washington D.C. They believe their role as musicians is not just to entertain or to weave a
                        masterful story, but to create moments of true connection between people, and they carry this principle into their work
                        as both performers and educators.

                        The Astrodon Quartet is a recipient of Mount Vernon Virtuosi’s string quartet fellowship. Mount Vernon Virtuosi is a
                        nonprofit organization in Baltimore that provides free string orchestra and string quartet concerts to the public and
                        free music education to Baltimore public schools. Astrodon’s first year has been marked by weekly performances for the
                        organization as well as many exciting collaborations, including performances with clarinetist Alexander Fiterstein and
                        projects with local visual artists. The group lives together in the MVV’s Mars Music House, where they rehearse and
                        perform, and they also teach at two Baltimore public schools, KIPP Academy and the Green School. They are honored to
                        have been coached by Amit Peled and members of the Calidore and Cavani String Quartets.

                                Hailing from Hopewell, New Jersey, Dallas Noble is one of the violinists in the Astrodon Quartet, Mount Vernon
                                Virtuosi's fellowship string quartet for the 2025-26 season. This is Dallas's first year with MVV, and they are so
                                excited to be working alongside their colleagues to provide free concerts and music education to the Baltimore
                                community.

                                Dallas is a graduate of the Colburn Conservatory, where they studied with Robert Lipsett, and the University of
                                Delaware, where they studied with Jeffrey Myers and the Calidore String Quartet. They were a member of UD's Graduate
                                String Quartet-in-Residence program from 2023-25, during which time their ensemble (Trellis String Quartet) was a
                                prizewinner at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and performed with the Verona Quartet in one of ENCORE Chamber
                                Music Festival's mainstage concerts.

                                Dallas's primary passion, alongside chamber music, has always been connecting with the people around them. During their
                                time in Los Angeles, they began serving the Skid Row community with two organizations (Urban Voices Project and Street
                                Symphony) that fundamentally changed their life and relationship with music, and since then, their aspiration has been
                                to use music for the healing, empowerment, and liberation of all people.

                                When they're not being a huge nerd about string quartet music and spamming the Astrodon group chat, Dallas enjoys
                                teaching, writing, making playlists, trying new recipes (most of which are desserts), going on runs, exploring new
                                places, looking up hikes to go on and only going on 25% of them, desperately trying to keep tomato plants alive, working
                                on their spreadsheet of community organizations in the U.S. and Canada, cooking with Baltimore Food not Bombs, and
                                trying to befriend the crows that live in their backyard.

                                Dallas's favorite places in Baltimore so far are Wyman Park, the Music House (obvs), the community garden on Maryland
                                Ave, and St. Luke's Church on the Avenue.

                                season. He is extremely excited for this opportunity, as this fellowship places established musicians in under-served
                                areas of Baltimore to provide free music lessons and performances throughout the community, at venues such as schools
                                and hospitals, in addition to traditional concert appearances.

                                String Quartet. He was a member of UD's Graduate String Quartet-in-Residence program from 2023-25 with his ensemble
                                Trellis String Quartet. Zach completed his Bachelor's Degree at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, where he
                                studied with Philippe Djokic, Leo Perez, and Mark Lee.

                                Zach has performed regularly with Symphony Nova Scotia, as well as in NYO Canada's "Frenergy" collaboration tour (2019)
                                with the European Union Youth Orchestra. In 2023, Zach performed and mentored as a "Rising Star" in Vancouver Academy of
                                Music's Sea to Sky Chamber Festival. Throughout his undergraduate program, Zach performed multiple times as a soloist
                                with Dalhousie's Symphony Orchestra, on both viola and violin. He also developed a love for theatre while at Dalhousie,
                                composing music for two musicals.

                                Originally from Vancouver, Canada, Zach began his violin pursuit with Nicki Stieda, and the Vancouver Academy of Music;
                                he later studied with Andrew Dawes (of the Orford String Quartet). A major part of Zach's passion for chamber music

                            Dallas's primary passion, alongside chamber music, has always been connecting with the people around them. During their
                            time in Los Angeles, they began serving the Skid Row community with two organizations (Urban Voices Project and Street
                            Symphony) that fundamentally changed their life and relationship with music, and since then, their aspiration has been
                            to use music for the healing, empowerment, and liberation of all people.

                            places, looking up hikes to go on and only going on 25% of them, desperately trying to keep tomato plants alive, working
                            on their spreadsheet of community organizations in the U.S. and Canada, cooking with Baltimore Food not Bombs, and
                            trying to befriend the crows that live in their backyard.

                            String Quartet-in-Residence program from 2023-25, during which time their ensemble (Trellis String Quartet) was a
                            prizewinner at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and performed with the Verona Quartet in one of ENCORE Chamber

                            Dallas's primary passion, alongside chamber music, has always been connecting with the people around them. During their
                            time in Los Angeles, they began serving the Skid Row community with two organizations (Urban Voices Project and Street
                            Symphony) that fundamentally changed their life and relationship with music, and since then, their aspiration has been
                            to use music for the healing, empowerment, and liberation of all people.

                            When they're not being a huge nerd about string quartet music and spamming the Astrodon group chat, Dallas enjoys
                            teaching, writing, making playlists, trying new recipes (most of which are desserts), going on runs, exploring new
                            places, looking up hikes to go on and only going on 25% of them, desperately trying to keep tomato plants alive, working
                            on their spreadsheet of community organizations in the U.S. and Canada, cooking with Baltimore Food not Bombs, and
                            trying to befriend the crows that live in their backyard.

                            with the European Union Youth Orchestra. In 2023, Zach performed and mentored as a "Rising Star" in Vancouver Academy of
                            Music's Sea to Sky Chamber Festival. Throughout his undergraduate program, Zach performed multiple times as a soloist
                            with Dalhousie's Symphony Orchestra, on both viola and violin. He also developed a love for theatre while at Dalhousie,
                            composing music for two musicals.

                            he later studied with Andrew Dawes (of the Orford String Quartet). A major part of Zach’s passion for chamber music
                            stems from his time with Andy, such as discussing string quartets while helping around on Andy’s sailboat. In his free
                            time, Zach enjoys watching baseball, finding new films and shows, and being a foodie. A couple of his favorite places in
                            Baltimore so far are The Coral Wig, Sophomore Coffee, and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
